The goal of this project is to implement most discriminative supervised learning techniques. It is a way for me to reinforce my knowledge of basic supervised learning techniques. I also need to practice my practical machine learning techniques such as validation, regularization, debugging; etc.
What I implemented
Normal equation for linear classification

What I'm trying
Gradient Descent
